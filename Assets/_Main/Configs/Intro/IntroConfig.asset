  - Glnog started learning ancient magic with his grandpa since he was 2 years old.
  - "This magic was called \u201CAncestral Flame\u201D, at least this is how the
    grandpa called it."
  - "Glnog spent a whole 4 years learning \u201CAncestral Flame\u201D, no wonder
    - not every frog can learn this magic!"
  - One day after these long 4 years Glnog was returning home after a long training,
    as usual, called his grandpa...
  - But to his surprise, there was no response. Glnog tried to find him, but he only
    found a piece of paper on his grandpa's working table
  - '"Dear Glnog. I will be waiting for you at the highest peak of the Dark Valley
    and there we shall determine if your training has reached its culmination"'
